This "data" folder is the working directory of Ayax Development Kit (ADK).
The executable file (e.g. "ADK.exe") that is built should be placed inside
this folder before running.
You can set CLion or Visual Studio to use this folder as the working directory
automatically in their run or debug configurations.
